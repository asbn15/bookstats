It took me forever to get used to the writing style and get a grasp on what I was reading about. At the same time, I am very glad I persevered and pushed through to keep reading the book because this book is by far the most creative book I have ever read. Its probably not for everyone, and a lot of people will probably give up, but I must say, I really did enjoy it by the end of the book.<br/>Give it a try, and maybe give yourself more time than you normally would to get a grasp on this book. I will definitely be reading the next one.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
